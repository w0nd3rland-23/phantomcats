            <p>In the early 1890s, sheep began to vanish around the small town of Tantanoola, in regional South
                Australia.

            <p>Years prior, a travelling circus between the towns of Millicent and Mt Gambier, South Australia set camp
                for the night. When dawn broke, the horrifying discovery that a Bengal tiger within the circus ranks had
                escaped into the Australian bush.

            <p>At first, the circus attempted to retrieve the animals themselves. However, with no success, the local
                police were soon alerted. Following this, a widespread search for the tiger occurred, but there were no
                sightings. </p>

    <div class="regular-section">

            <p>Sheep continued to vanish in the years following, the mythic tiger being named the culprit.

                In 1893, sightings began to occur of a large predator. Claims that the beast was carrying a fully grown
                sheep within its jaws.

            <p>However, in 1885, a potential clue to solve the mystery was finally discovered. </p>
            <p>In 1885, a beast was shot and killed 20km south of Tantalooga at Mt Salt Station by Tom Donovan. The body
                of the animal was taken to a taxidermist in Mount Gambier, where it was identified as an Assyrian or
                Northern Russian Wolf, its body being put on display to the public. </p>

            <p>Unfortunately for the town of Tantalooga, the mystery dragged on, with hundreds of sheep continuing to

            <p>The missing livestock enigma continued to plague the area until 1910 when Adelaide detective Herbert
                Allchurch was contacted to help solve the mystery. <br><br>Fittingly, the culprit of the town's problems
                was apprehended at the Tiger Hotel in Tantalgoola. A local rabbit shooter, Charlie Edmuson was arrested
                by Allchruch and put before a trial. He admitted to stealing and killing over 4000 sheep and selling the
                skins over the past 20 years. </p>

            <p>The Tantanoola Tiger is one of the earliest recorded cases of Australia’s fascination with the idea of
                phantom cats, also known as alien big cats. These are animals that have been reported to inhabit
                locations that are not their native environments, a phenomenon observed in various countries globally.

    <div class="parallax-section-7">
        <div class="blacktext-2">
            <p>In June of 2005, Kurt Engel, a local hunter was pursuing deer around the town of Sale in Gippsland.
                <br><br><br><br> While in the dense scrub, he noticed large paw prints in a nearby creek bed. </p>

        </div>

    <div class="parallax-section-8">
        <div class="blacktext-2">
            <p>Shortly following this discovery, he was met with mysterious eyes in the shadows. He quickly spotted a
                large crouching cat, keeping himself quiet and still.</p>
        </div>
    </div>


    <div class="regular-section">
        <div class="text-content">
            <p>
                Suddenly, the cat made a rapid leap towards him.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>


    <div class="parallax-section-9">
        <div class="blacktext-2">
            <p>Engel raised his shotgun, as the animal made a turn to the left. On its third leap, Engel made his shot,
                killing the cat. </p>

    <div class="regular-section">
        <div class="text-content">
            <p>
                The shot reportedly went through its shoulder, completely blowing the head of the cat off.
                <br><br><br><br>
                With the cat’s body unsalvageable, he opted to photograph the remains and cut off the tail to claim as
                evidence, discarding the remaining body into a local river.
                <br><br><br><br>
                Engel's story caught the attention of Mike Williams, a representative of the British Centre for Fortean
                Zoology, with Williams requesting the fur samples to be sent for DNA testing. The tail was sent off for
                testing, to determine the true nature of the cat's species.

    <div class="parallax-section-10">
        <div class="blacktext-2">
            <p>The results returned, concluding, that the cat was moggy, a mixed domestic cat breed. </p>
            <br><br><br><br>
            <p> Disappointed, Engel responded by claiming it was the “biggest cat in the world if that's the case." </p>

                The results of Kurt Engel's hunting trip mark just one chapter in the stories of the Gippsland panther,
                with widespread claims of big cats in the area spanning over 50 years.
                <br><br><br><br>
                Even today, local online community groups in the area frequently update thousands online on new
                suspected sightings and stories, raising the question: how much smoke can exist without fire?

                The Grampian’s Puma is our final case study into the Phantom Cats of Australia, and perhaps the most
                compelling evidence of their existence. For over 60 years the Grampian's Puma sightings have been a

            <p>The folklore around the Grampians puma brought about the largest scale scientific study in Australia into
                the phenomena, the Deakin Puma Study. Started in 1976, and eventually published in 2001, the study
                explored the possibility of large cat populations in the area.

            <p>The study began with an environmental studies field trip group visiting the Grampians. One night, a
                student going to his tent saw large yellow eyes reflecting in the night through his flashlight. The
                group's leader, and writer of the study, John Henry, recounted a story of a puma sighting from Ellis
                Tucker, a prominent member of the Hamilton Field Naturalists Society. </p>

            <p>“It was 10 o’clock in the morning on a sunny day. I was driving back up that road towards the Glenelg
                River crossing. When I got to that bridge a puma came out from the bushes on the side of the road and
                slowly loped across in front of me. I had a perfect view of the animal for almost a minute. It was a
                typical cat shape but about 2 feet (600mm) high at the shoulder, 3.5 feet (105mm) long in the body with
                a 3 foot (900mm) long tail curved down to the ground. It was ginger brown in colour, thick set with a
                round shaped head and small ears and short neck. It had thick legs for an animal this size”.

            <p>In a discussion the following morning, the group decided to commit to a further exploration of the
                Grampians in search of the predators, dubbing themselves as the ‘puma hunters’. This group of students
                formed the basis of the Deakin Puma Study, returning to the Grampians a month later.

            <p>The study involved various methods of examining evidence of scat, tracks, bones of large predator kills,

                The conclusion of the study found that there was enough evidence “to affirm beyond reasonable doubt the
                presence of a big-cat population in Western Victoria”. John Henry’s study ultimately not only concluded
                that there is a likelihood of a puma colony in the Grampians, but also that this population would
                continue to grow in numbers.

            <p>The elusive big cats of Australia are a fascinating phenomenon to explore. Both the geographical scale of
                the sightings and the time period they span add intrigue to the mystery, with these case studies only
                scratching the surface of the history of phantom cats in Australia.

        <div class="blacktext-2">
            <p>
                The most compelling argument against the existence of phantom cats is in the lack of concrete evidence
                supporting the widespread claims. Questions arise as to how there have been no recorded detections in
                wildlife surveys, bodies retrieved by hunters, or skeletal remains found. As was the case with the
                Gippsland Panther, the suspect of these sightings to debunk the myth of phantom cats is most widely
                believed to be large Felis catus or large domestic cats.

            <p>
                Despite this, Australia’s fascination with phantom big cats persists. Facebook groups, online forums,
                newspaper articles and videos of suspected sightings frequently appear online, propelling further
                interest in the mystery.
                <br><br><br><br>
                The mystery of the Australian phantom cats remains largely unresolved, despite the captivation of so
                many throughout the past decades. Social media has contributed to larger communities discussing their
                own experience with the legend, spreading the word of the big cats to ever-growing audiences.
            </p> <br><br><br>
            <p>Whether myth or reality, undeniably, these rumoured panthers, pumas and tigers have struck long-lasting
                intrigue and curiosity in the communities of Australian towns, fuelling this legend for generations past
                and future.
