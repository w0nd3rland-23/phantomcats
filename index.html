            <p>In the early 1890s, sheep began to vanish around the small town of Tantanoola, in regional South Australia.
            </p>
            <img src="img/sheeps.jpg">
            <p>Years prior, a travelling circus between the towns of Millicent and Mt Gambier, South Australia set camp for the night. When dawn broke, the horrifying discovery that a Bengal tiger within the circus ranks had escaped into the Australian bush.

    <div class="parallax-section-3">
        <div class="blacktext">
            <p>At first, the circus attempted to retrieve the animals themselves. However, with no success, the local police were soon alerted.  Following this, a widespread search for the tiger occurred, but there were no sightings. </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="regular-section">
        <div class="text-content">
        <p>Sheep continued to vanish in the years following, the mythic tiger being named the culprit. 

            In 1893, sightings began to occur of a large predator. Claims that the beast was carrying a fully grown sheep within its jaws.

    <div class="parallax-section-2">
        <div class="blacktext">
            <p>The mystery grew, with sightings continuing in escalating severity. The sightings spread from Robe to Bendigo.  </p>
           
        </div>
     
    </div>

    <div class="regular-section">
        <div class="text-content">
            <p>However, in 1885, a potential clue to solve the mystery was finally discovered. </p>
            <p>In 1885, a beast was shot and killed 20km south of Tantalooga at Mt Salt Station by Tom Donovan. The body of the animal was taken to a taxidermist in Mount Gambier, where it was identified as an Assyrian or Northern Russian Wolf, its body being put on display to the public. </p>

    <div class="parallax-section-4">
        <div class="blacktext">
           <p>Unfortunately for the town of Tantalooga, the mystery dragged on, with hundreds of sheep continuing to vanish in the night over the subsequent years. </p>

    </div>

    <div class="parallax-section-5">
        <div class="blacktext-2">
            <p>The missing livestock enigma continued to plague the area until 1910 when Adelaide detective Herbert Allchurch was contacted to help solve the mystery. <br><br>Fittingly, the culprit of the town's problems was apprehended at the Tiger Hotel in Tantalgoola. A local rabbit shooter, Charlie Edmuson was arrested by Allchruch and put before a trial. He admitted to stealing and killing over 4000 sheep and selling the skins over the past 20 years. </p>

            <p>The Tantanoola Tiger is one of the earliest recorded cases of Australia’s fascination with the idea of phantom cats, also known as alien big cats. These are animals that have been reported to inhabit locations that are not their native environments, a phenomenon observed in various countries globally.

        <div class="blacktext-2">
       <p>In June of 2005, Kurt Engel, a local hunter was pursuing deer around the town of Sale in Gippsland. <br><br><br><br> While in the dense scrub, he noticed large paw prints in a nearby creek bed. </p>
   
        </div>
    </div>


    <div class="parallax-section-8">
        <div class="blacktext-2">
       <p>Shortly following this discovery, he was met with mysterious eyes in the shadows.  He quickly spotted a large crouching cat, keeping himself quiet and still.</p>
        </div>
    </div>


    <div class="regular-section">
        <div class="text-content">
       <p>
        Suddenly, the cat made a rapid leap towards him. 
       </p>
        </div>
    </div>


    <div class="parallax-section-9">
        <div class="blacktext-2">
       <p>Engel raised his shotgun, as the animal made a turn to the left. On its third leap, Engel made his shot, killing the cat. </p>
        </div>
    </div>


    <div class="regular-section">
        <div class="text-content">
       <p>
        The shot reportedly went through its shoulder, completely blowing the head of the cat off. 
        <br><br><br><br>
        With the cat’s body unsalvageable, he opted to photograph the remains and cut off the tail to claim as evidence, discarding the remaining body into a local river. 
        <br><br><br><br>
        Engel's story caught the attention of Mike Williams, a representative of the British Centre for Fortean Zoology, with Williams requesting the fur samples to be sent for DNA testing. The tail was sent off for testing, to determine the true nature of the cat's species.

    </div>


    <div class="parallax-section-10">
        <div class="blacktext-2">
       <p>The results returned, concluding, that the cat was moggy, a mixed domestic cat breed. </p>
       <br><br><br><br>
       <p> Disappointed, Engel responded by claiming it was the “biggest cat in the world if that's the case." </p>

        The results of Kurt Engel's hunting trip mark just one chapter in the stories of the Gippsland panther, with widespread claims of big cats in the area spanning over 50 years.
        <br><br><br><br>
        Even today, local online community groups in the area frequently update thousands online on new suspected sightings and stories, raising the question: how much smoke can exist without fire?

        The Grampian’s Puma is our final case study into the Phantom Cats of Australia, and perhaps the most compelling evidence of their existence. For over 60 years the Grampian's Puma sightings have been a popular campfire tale. 
        <br><br><br><br>
        The most well known version of the legend concerns the US Army and their large feline mascots.

    <div class="parallax-section-12">
        <div class="blacktext-2">
             <p>In 1942, US servicemen stationed in the Grampians area were accompanied by their mascots, 5 panthers and pumas. </p>
        </div>
    </div>
  
    <div class="regular-section">
        <div class="text-content">
            <p>Upon being notified of the animal's presence, the Australia Quarantine Services ordered the servicemen to kill the animals.

    </div>
    
    <div class="parallax-section-13">
        <div class="blacktext-2">
             <p>Despite these orders, supposedly, the men opted to avoid executing the animals, instead releasing the animals into the Grampian mountains.  </p>
             <p>These cats are said to have bred and thrived in the mountains. </p>

            <p>The folklore around the Grampians puma brought about the largest scale scientific study in Australia into the phenomena, the Deakin Puma Study. Started in 1976, and eventually published in 2001, the study explored the possibility of large cat populations in the area.

    <div class="parallax-section-14">
        <div class="blacktext-2">
             <p>The study began with an environmental studies field trip group visiting the Grampians. One night, a student going to his tent saw large yellow eyes reflecting in the night through his flashlight. The group's leader, and writer of the study, John Henry, recounted a story of a puma sighting from Ellis Tucker, a prominent member of the Hamilton Field Naturalists Society.  </p>

            <p>“It was 10 o’clock in the morning on a sunny day. I was driving back up that road towards the Glenelg River crossing. When I got to that bridge a puma came out from the bushes on the side of the road and slowly loped across in front of me. I had a perfect view of the animal for almost a minute. It was a typical cat shape but about 2 feet (600mm) high at the shoulder, 3.5 feet (105mm) long in the body with a 3 foot (900mm) long tail curved down to the ground. It was ginger brown in colour, thick set with a round shaped head and small ears and short neck. It had thick legs for an animal this size”.

    <div class="parallax-section-15">
        <div class="blacktext-2">
             <p>The students, both made curious and fearful by the story, stayed close to the base camp that night.   </p>
     
            </div>
    </div>

    <div class="regular-section">
        <div class="text-content">
        
            <p>In a discussion the following morning, the group decided to commit to a further exploration of the Grampians in search of the predators, dubbing themselves as the ‘puma hunters’. This group of students formed the basis of the Deakin Puma Study, returning to the Grampians a month later.

            <p>The study involved various methods of examining evidence of scat, tracks, bones of large predator kills, and observations from 22 alleged puma observers. </p>

                The conclusion of the study found that there was enough evidence “to affirm beyond reasonable doubt the presence of a big-cat population in Western Victoria”. John Henry’s study ultimately not only concluded that there is a likelihood of a puma colony in the Grampians, but also that this population would continue to grow in numbers.
